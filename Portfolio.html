            <li>First of all, I was a horrible student, when I had to study something I didn't like, I didn't studied it... </li>
            <li>I did a degree on IT, but in Spain you need experience to start working (and no business gives apprenticite)</li>
            <li>When I was 22, I decided to move to London because in Spain ain't got job in that time. 
            <br> As I had to work in hospitality, I lost any touch with technology and I started to (fake)feel comfortable because I was having money</li>

            she punished me without computer because she thought I was infesting the PC with virus... lol

    This link is a logo I design for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Mandragames/photos/a.283905981723674/283905991723673">
        'Mandragames', it wasn't a proper company, just a few friends who I could gather and code. They showed me how to create the scape room, since then, "All you need is Code"
