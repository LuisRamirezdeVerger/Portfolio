            <li>I did a degree on IT, but in Spain you need experience to start working (and no business gives apprenticite)</li>
            <li>When I was 22, I decided to move to London because in Spain ain't got job in that time. 
            <br> As I had to work in hospitality, I lost any touch with technology and I started to (fake)feel comfortable because I was having money</li>
